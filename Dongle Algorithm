Dongle Algorithm

1. User enters "generate" into console 
2. Dongle generates a random key 
    - starts a 1 minute timer
    - stores the key in a struct
    - after 1 minute if the user has not put in the key
    - the key in struct is reset to invalid sentinel
3. User inputs the random key
4. Dongle validates the key:
    - cross reference it with the key in the struct
    - if a match, flag the user as logged in
    - output an easter egg
5. If invalid Dongle outputs error
